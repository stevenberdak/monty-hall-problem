# Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is as follows:
1. A contestant is given 3 doors to choose from at random where only one of them is winning.
2. After the contestant selects a door the host removes one of the other choices (which does not include the winning door).
3. The contestant is given the option to choose between keeping their choice or switching to the other remaining door.

The reason this problem is interesting is because it is provable that switching doors will yield a greater than 50% win ratio and
not switching doors will yield a less than 50% win ratio.
